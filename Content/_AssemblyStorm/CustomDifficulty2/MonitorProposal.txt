A monitor is a standalone actor that is responsible for monitoring specific values or events from the game which can be retrieved and used by consumer mutators. A monitor will be instantiated when a mutator that consumes it is first built. 

Monitors do not need to handle replication. Monitors that require authority should only be instantiated on the listen server and mutators that consume from it should properly flag requires authority.

Unlike mutators, at most one monitor of each type will exist. As such, performance is less of a concern and active evaluation/monitoring is unlikely to negatively impact performance. Monitors can be influenced by mutators, but monitors should not maintain a list of mutator consumers them or otherwise initiate interaction with consumers. 

While mutators have a lifecycle controlled by CD2 core. Monitors once started will run through the remainder of the mission whether they are used or not.

Monitors should not make any changes to the game that would need to be reverted to return to a vanilla game experience.
