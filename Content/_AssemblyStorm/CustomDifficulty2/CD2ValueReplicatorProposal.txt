Value Replicaton:

Value Construction with replication option:
Built Root Mutator.
If the mutator does not require authority continue as normal.
Else:
    If host:
        Create a ValueReplicatorComponent, Bind OnChange/OnReady to the replicator.
            The mutator manager notifies a valuereplicator was created by multicast
        This value calls the OnChange and OnReady delegates on the valuereplicator
    If client:
        Doesn't attach the root mutator
        Instead it checks with the mutator manager to see if the correct valuereplicator is available.
        If it isnt, it binds to an event on the MutatorManager to wait for the valuereplicator to replicate
        When the replicated value is available:
            If the valuereplicator is ready+has a cached value:
                Call OnChange and OnReady
                Bind to OnChange
            Else:
                Bind to OnChange and OnReady


When mutators are torn down, replicatorvalues are also torn down.
